# Jolly-Pop-Injector
A C# DLL Injector with customizable settings.

It has the following features:
-Settings where you can set up automatic injection, closing the program after successful automatic injection, saving the previously
used location of the DLL and the previous process, and more.
-XML configuration file (lol this is a feature?)
-and uh... I guess it's in .NET?
